# Erik Gratz' 24hr code challenge

Hey there! Thanks for considering me for this position. 
Let's get right into it.

To run the program, unzip the files and navigate your 
terminal to their parent directory.

Run command "php run.php" and the basic CLI will start. 
(You should have php installed, of course...)

Choose whether to run the model tests, 
the predetermined test cases from datasets.md, 
and the Complete Assignment case with (Y/N) inputs.
The Complete Assignment case will output each generation 
to the CLI for you to review.

That's it! Thanks for your consideration!
